    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>My name is Freya and I am currently a 2nd year student at Wyke Sixth Form College. I have a passion for Games Design
    and I have designed this portfolio to show my interest in the subject. My portfolio has been split into four sections, each
    with the intent of showing a different aspect of game design. 
    <br><br>
    The first section is titled 'Cliffhanger' and covers a large
    project which aims to show how I can take a concept and develop it into a prototype game. The second section, titled
    'Crown of Shadows' aims to show level and environment design as well as some narrative design. The third section is titled
    'Notes' and contains a collection of game ideas and concepts, showing how I conceptualise a game. The final section is titled
    'Games' and covers general problem solving and programming concepts.

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I've grown up loving video games, starting with playing Crash Bandicoot 3 on our PS2 with my dad. Throughout my childhood, my hobby has grown
      into a passion. Some of my favourite games include The Last of Us, Baldur's Gate 3 and Death Stranding, I love narrative and level desgin which
      I think these games expertly display. Having played many games in the past, I have started to understand and appreciate the behind-the-scenes work that 
      goes into making a game. Throughout my time at college, I have developed skills and projects which show my understanding of Games Design, all of
      which have been used to create this portfolio.
