      <p><i>Crown of Shadows</i> is a prototype RPG made in RPG Maker MV. The goal of this project was to <br>practice creating 2D environments 
        and levels while also trying to work on narrative writing. <br>This project is unfinished but still contains many explorable areas such 
        as the Village, Mountain Caves, Forest Trail, <br>as well many buildings which can be entered and explored.
        <br><br>
        One of my main interests in game design is level design so this project was an opportunity to practice<br> designing levels which allow the player to explore
        while still guiding them towards an endpoint. I designed all<br> of the maps myself using RPG Maker's assets, which allowed me to create a variety of levels
        of different sizes and<br> environments. The game also>contains a very bare narrative which I would have liked to explore more if I had the time,<br> as the player
        interacts with NPCs, they can learn pieces of backstory about the characters.
        <br><br>
        Using the database system which RPG Maker MV provides, I created a multitude of enemies (Such as bats, <br>spiders, bandits, etc.) each with different amounts
        of health and defense. I also created custom classes<br> (Cleric, Fighter, Bard, Barbarian) inspired by the classes from Dungeons and Dragons. These classes all
        have <br>custom spells and actions which progessively unlock as the player levels up by gainging XP. Additionally, each of the <br>classes' stats progress differently.
        For example, a barbarian will have a greater maximum health than a cleric. <br>It was important for me to have varied character progression to ensure that each of the
        party <br>members are unique and interesting.

    <center><h1>The Village</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The Village is the main area of the game, containing multiple buildings which have explorable interiors<br> such as the Inn, Store 
      and various houses. The aim of the Village is to provide the player with a large, open<br> area to explore at their own pace. As the 
      player explores, they can speak to all of the NPCs and unlock quests from a<br> few of them. I designed the layout of the village to try and encourage 
      the player to see most of the area. <br>For example, the player starts the game in one of the houses in the top right corner of the map, 
      they are then encouraged to <br>follow the stone path which is designed to pass most of the buildddings.</p><br>

    <br><br><br>
    <center><h1>Forest Trail</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The trail acts as a hub of access to other areas. This is the first location the player will enter upon <br>
      leaving the village and acts as a simple transition area to help pace the game. From here, the player can <br>
      access the caves and the village with additional paths which would have led to more areas if I had the time to <br>
      implement them. I intentionally made the trail free of enemies and NPCs to slow down the pace of the game <br>
      before it starts to pick back up when the player enters the next area.

    <br><br><br>
    <center><h1>Mountain Caves</h1>
    <br>
    <p> The Mountain Caves is the most combat-heavy area of the game. Upon entering, the player can explore a series of <br>
      caverns and tunnels while fighting enemies. The player will randomly encounter enemies as they explore which encourages<br> 
      them to experience the battle mechanics that the RPG has to offer. This also allows them to level up the characters and <br>
      unlock new abilities before the boss battle at the end of the area. There are also chests and other items to find and loot <br>
      throughout the caves, this is to encourage exploration. <br><br>
      When the player reaches the end of the caves, they enter an area <br>
      filled with bandits and have to complete a boss fight. I made the boss to be more powerful than the other bandits to ensure<br>
      that it is challenging but stil possible. When the player defeats the boss, they have the option to recruit a new character <br>
      who had been captured by the bandits, which could lead into a side quest covering her capture.

    <br><br><br>
    <center><h1>Interiors</h1>
    <br>
    <p> Every building in the game can be entered and explored, including the many houses as well as the Inn, Church and Store.<br>
      I wanted each building to have a visually interesting interior while also adding more context and life to the game. For example,<br>
      the player can enter the shop and purchase helpful items such as healing potions which will aid them in battle. Addittionally,<br>
      the player can enter the church and make an offering to unlock damage buffs, or they can explore the basement to find and recruit<br>
      one of the potential party members.<br><br>
      I think that allowing the player to explore the buildings makes the game feel larger and more engagingm, which is crucial for the<br>
      user experience. Furthermore, rewarding this exploration with items, buffs and new quests helps to make the player feel like exploring<br>
      is worth their time and is not pointless.
